# Connection Request Automation
To get maximum visibility of the post in LinkedIn, you require a large number of audience or connections. So this is 
a Javascript code which will send an automatic connection request to the LinkedIn's suggested people and hence will increase 
the number of connections.

## Requirements
1. Code editor ( Preferably VSCode )
2. npm 
3. git

## Installations
First install all the above requirements and then run the below commands in terminal of VSCode
* git clone https://github.com/AnandPr123/AutomateLinkedInConnectionRequest.git

Open the index.js file and type your own LinkedIn username and Password. After that run below commands in terminal
* npm install
* node index.js

That's it!
